Hi, I am a graduate student studying computational cognitive neuroscience. I graduated from Seoul National University in 2018 with a B.A. in psychology and a M.A. in neuroscience. I’m interested in how humans and animals learn from rewards and punishments to guide goal-directed behavior. I’m applying for PhD programs this fall to continue my research. I like movies, beers, and changing seasons.
