I am a graduate student studying psychology and neuroscience. I graduated from Seoul National University in 2018 with a B.A. in psychology and an M.A. in neuroscience with a focus on clinical neuroscience. My current research interests are computational cognitive neuroscience approaches to learning and decision-making and I am applying for PhD programs this fall to continue exploring these topics. Outside of academia, I enjoy watching movies, drinking beers, and walking in cold weather.
