Hello, I am a graduate student studying psychology and neuroscience. I graduated from Seoul National University in 2018 with a B.A. in psychology and a M.A. in neuroscience with a focus on clinical neuroscience. My current research interests are in computational cognitive neuroscience approaches to reinforcement learning, decision-making and cognitive control. Iâ€™m applying for PhD programs this fall to continue exploring these topics. Other than research, I like movies, daydreaming while drinking beers, and cold weather.
