### Research
My broad research interests lie in comparative politics and the political economy of development. My current projects centre on: 
* women's political mobilisation and collective action, 
* persistence and erosion of ideology in political parties,
* public service delivery in decentralised contexts,
* historical origins of ethnic conflict, and
* whether and how voters use information to hold politicians accountable, and cumulative learning.
