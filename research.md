### Research
My research focuses on the neural and computational processes underlying reinforcement learning and cognitive control. I use a combination of behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging techniques to understand these processes. Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in the following questions: 

**Structure learning**
*	How do we learn latent structure shared across multiple task environments, and generalize this structured knowledge to a novel task? 
*	How do we learn a hierarchical structure in action policies? That is, how do we learn to decompose our action space into a set of sub-problems in which more abstract, higher-level actions guide selections of more elemental, lower-level actions?     
*	What neural mechanisms enable structure learning? Specifically, what are the roles of recurrent dynamics in prefrontal cortex?

**State representation**
*	How do we determine which stimuli/actions to consider (or ignore) in the decision-making process? 
*	In predicting future states and rewards, how do we combine the memory of previous states with the noisy observation of the current state? 
*	How does state uncertainty regulate subsequent learning and decision-making strategies?
